Sentiment Analysis Project
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This project aims to determine the sentiment (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) expressed in text reviews. It's designed to help you understand how people feel about products or services based on their written feedback.

Overview
This project involves the following steps:

Data Preparation: We clean and prepare the data to ensure it's ready for analysis. This involves handling missing values and categorizing the reviews based on their scores.

Model Training: We use a machine learning model to learn patterns in the data and predict the sentiment of new reviews. The model is trained to recognize whether a review is Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

Evaluation: We assess the model's performance by checking how accurately it predicts the sentiment. We use metrics like accuracy and F1 score, and visualize the results with charts.

Deployment: The final step is deployment, where we make the model available for use. You can input a review, and the model will predict its sentiment.

How It Works
Data: The data used in this project consists of text reviews along with their scores. A review with a score above 3 is considered "Positive," a score below 3 is "Negative," and a score of 3 is "Neutral."

Model: The machine learning model analyzes the text and identifies patterns that are commonly associated with Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can predict the sentiment of any new review you give it.

How to Use This Project
Clone the Repository: First, download the project files from GitHub to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-project.git
Install the Required Libraries: Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook: Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment. You can follow the steps in the notebook to see how the data is processed, the model is trained, and how predictions are made.

Predict Sentiment: You can input your own text reviews and see the predicted sentiment.

Example
Here’s a simple example:

Review: "This product is amazing! I love it."

Prediction: Positive

Review: "The service was okay, not great but not bad either."

Prediction: Neutral

Review: "I didn't like this at all. It was a waste of money."

Prediction: Negative

Conclusion
This project is a great tool for businesses to understand customer feedback and improve their products or services. Even if you’re not a technical person, this project will help you gain insights into how people feel about what you offer.
